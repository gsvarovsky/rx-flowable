 *
 * This is an interface to ease the use of RxJS pipe operators and utilities
 * like `EMPTY`. However note that some (e.g. `from` and `merge`)
 * may create misbehaving consumables that flow with incorrect backpressure.
 *
 * Note that a consumable is generally more prone to resource leaks than a
 * typical observable, because resources may be held open while waiting for
 * backpressure to be relieved by a call to {@link Bite.next()}. Such leaks
 * can even occur if the consumable is never subscribed, because of pre-emptive
 * actions taken when it was created, prior to the first consumer/subscriber.
